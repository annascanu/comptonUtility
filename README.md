# comptonUtility
 A series of codes which can be helpful for our Compton lab experience. 

 In particular, this code allows you to:
 - fit data with Gaussian peaks and exponential/erfc-like backgrounds;
 - check for linearity of certain sets of data;
 - utilities for the optimization of instrumentation used throughout the experience (for example, putting the FWHM of the observed gaussian peaks as a function of certain parameters);
 - etc.

In the test directory you can find some .txt files useful to test out the code:
- **calibrated.txt** contains the data to perform FWHM vs Amplifier gain linear fit;
- **Sample2_90.txt** contains the data of a Compton measurement (for ϑ = 90°), to fit with a linear background;
- other options are going to be added.


 **Note that this is still a work in progress!**
