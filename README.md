# comptonUtility
 A series of codes which can be helpful for our Compton lab experience. 

 In particular, this code allows you to:
 - fit data with Gaussian peaks and exponential/erfc-like backgrounds;
 - check for linearity of certain sets of data;
 - utilities for the optimization of instrumentation used throughout the experience (for example, putting the FWHM of the observed gaussian peaks as a function of certain parameters);
 - etc.

 **Still a work in progress!**
